This is a simple full-stack TODO application where users can:

Create a task (with title and description)
View all tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks

The frontend is built with React, where users interact with a clean UI to manage their task list. The backend is powered by Express.js, and data is stored in a MongoDB database. The communication between frontend and backend happens through RESTful API endpoints.
